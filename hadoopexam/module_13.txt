sequence file
=============
file based data structure
	1) sequence file
	2) Map file

key 			value
binary format   binary format

producing log files every day
key can be timestamp and value can be file itself..

advantage: can compress the data
None, recordlevel which is file itself, blocklevel(first 3 records in block 1, next 3 in 2...)
lesser diskspace, less IO, less bandwidth, splittable on blocklevel

small file problem:
pool all small files by having a key and save it as sequence file...that way we can process one big file
